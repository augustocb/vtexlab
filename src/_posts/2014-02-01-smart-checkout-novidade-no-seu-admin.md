Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that’s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you’re in a toy store, because you’re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show’s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they’re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don’t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I’m in a transitional period so I don’t wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can’t give you this case, it don’t belong to me. Besides, I’ve already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

``` javascript
var GLOBALCAR = (function() {
    console.log("less is more!");
 
    // criando o objeto (vazio) box
    var box = {};
 
    // adicionando a propriedade queue (fila)
    box.queue = [];
 
    // adicionando o métodos addItem (adicionar item)
    box.addItem = function(car) {
        return box.queue.push(car);
    };
 
    // adicionando o métodos getQueue (recuperar fila)
    box.getQueue = function() {
        return box.queue.join(" - ");
    };
 
    // retornando um objeto personalizado (só com o necessário)
    return {
        add: box.addItem,
        get: box.getQueue
    };
})();
```

## FUCKIN’ UP THE WAY THE NIGGER TALKS.

Look, just because I don’t be givin’ no man a foot massage don’t make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin’ house, fuckin’ up the way the nigger talks. 

``` javascript
var get = function (url, callback) {
    //do a HTTP request for url which might take a while...
    (...)

    //when the result is available, 
    // call the second parameter, a function, with the result.
    callback(result);
};
```

Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, ‘cause I’ll kill the motherfucker, know what I’m sayin’?

``` javascript
var logGetResult = function (result) { console.log(result) };

// promiseForResult captures the possibility of an eventual result
var promiseForResult = get("http://givenumber.com/6");

// and we must tell it we're interested in the result, when available
promiseForResult.then(logGetResult);

// Which will log 6, eventually.
```

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I’m not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain’s going to be? He’s the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they’re friends, like you and me! I should’ve known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
